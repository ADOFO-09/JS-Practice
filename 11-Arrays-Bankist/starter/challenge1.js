// Coding Challenge #1 
// Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners 
// about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For 
// now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. 
// A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years 
// old. 
// Your tasks: 
// Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages 
// ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things: 
// 1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have 
// cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat 
// ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function 
// parameters) 
// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data 
// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 
// is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy 
// �
// �
//  4. Run the function for both test datasets 
// Test data: 
// ") 
// § Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3] 
// § Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4] 



const checkDogs = function(dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
    const CorrectedJulia = dogsJulia.slice(1,3);
    const dogs = CorrectedJulia.concat(dogsKate)
    console.log(dogs);
    dogs.forEach(function(dog, i){
        const age = dog >= 3 ? 
        `Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${dog} years old`:
        `Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy 🐶`;
        console.log(age);
    })
}

// checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3] )
// checkDogs([9, 16, 6, 8, 3], [10, 5, 6, 1, 4] )


// Coding Challenge #2 
// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert 
// dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study. 
// Your tasks: 
// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's 
// ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order: 
// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is 
// <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, 
// humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4 
// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as 
// keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old) 
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know 
// from other challenges how we calculate averages 
// �
// �) 
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets 
// Test data: 
// § Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3] 
// § Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

const calcAverageHumanAge = function(ages){
    // const humanAge = ages.map(function(age){
    //     if(age <= 2){
    //        return age * 2
    //     }else if (age > 2){
    //         return 16 + age * 4
    //     }
    // })
    const humanAge = ages.map(age => age <= 2 ? age * 2 : 16 + age * 4)
    // Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old
    const Adults = humanAge.filter(age => age > 18)
    // Average human age of all adult dogs
    // const average = Adults.reduce((acc, age) => acc + age, 0) / Adults.length
    const average = Adults.reduce((acc, age, i, arr) => acc + age/ arr.length , 0)
    // 2 3 (2+3)/2 = 2.5 === 2/2 + 3/2 = 2.5
    return average 
}
const avg1 = calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
const avg2 = calcAverageHumanAge([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);
console.log(avg1, avg2)


// Coding Challenge #3 
// Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from Challenge #2, but this time 
// as an arrow function, and using chaining! 
// Test data: 
// § Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3] 
// § Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4] 

// Using Chaining Method
const calcAverageHumanAge1 = function(ages){
    const humanAge = ages
        .map(age => age <= 2 ? age * 2 : 16 + age * 4)
        .filter(age => age > 18)
        .reduce((acc, age, i , arr) => acc + age/ arr.length, 0)
        return humanAge
}
const av1 = calcAverageHumanAge1([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3])
const av2 = calcAverageHumanAge1([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4])
console.log(av1, av2)
